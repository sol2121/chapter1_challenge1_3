# Challenge 1.3: The Dungeon Game (Decision & Repetition)
Description

This is a simple text-based dungeon game where the player moves through 5 rooms. Each room has a random event that affects the player's health: either a trap that hurts, a healing potion that restores health (but never above 100), or a monster that the player must defeat by guessing a number correctly. The game tests decision-making, loops, and conditionals while tracking health. The goal is to survive all 5 rooms and emerge victorious.

## Example Input/Output
Entering room 1...
You found a healing potion! Health is now 115 -> capped to 100.
Entering room 2...
A monster appears! Guess a number (1-5) to defeat it: 3
Wrong! Try again: 2
Wrong! Try again: 4
You defeated the monster!
Entering room 3...
A trap sprung! Health is now 80.
Entering room 4...
A monster appears! Guess a number (1-5) to defeat it: 1
You defeated the monster!
Entering room 5...
You found a healing potion! Health is now 95.
You cleared the dungeon! Victorious with 95 health!

## Reflection

This challenge helped me practice using loops (for and do-while), conditionals, and switch statements together in one program. Managing the player's health and making sure it doesnâ€™t go above the maximum required careful logic. The monster guessing mechanic was tricky at first since it required repeatedly asking for input until the correct guess, but using a do-while loop solved that neatly. Overall, this challenge strengthened my understanding of controlling program flow and working with random numbers and user input in Java.
